<!-- # Project Ideas

In this file (but not restricted to), you can use to get used to working on this repository and jot down project ideas to easily be shared with your mentors and to keep the history of! -->

these can be added to each of the project ideas below 
-----------------------------------------------------

take the basic idea of the api and make something more advanced with the data
coming up with ideas of more than just the basic CRUD
make it something that other people would find useful

note 1 and 2 more important than the 3rd one 
1 find exact apis, Omdb for movies for example find apis for the others and maybe look around for different movie apis that might be better
2 flesh out project ideas 2 and 3 / make them more like project idea 1
3 brainstorm low level db schema (nothing too crazy just a general layout of table names)

Project Idea 1\
using a movie based api to search for different movies\
save them as favorites\
personal rankings?\
populate reccomendations based on actors, genre etc\
make a list of movies to watch like best movie every year, top 25 highest rated of the 2000s, top 5 from x year, etc\
view each others saved lists

a meal plan for everyday of the week / month \
a gathering of ingredients for everything that the meal plan has on it (a grocery list)\
favorites / personal favorites / random recipe to try based on selected filters
